Classes
-are a defined data type which contatins member functions and data
this acts as the building block for object oriented, it is like a blue print for an object


Member functions
-a function declared within a class that can interact with the other objects of the class
if the function is wtihin the class it can interact with private objects if it is not it will need to use friendship to access these things




Objects and their lifecycles
-objects are specific classes, they are like the parts of the class 
lifecycle starts when initialization, if no destructor is used then until the end of the program


Constants and “friendship”
-constants used in classes can not be directly changed and an atempt to do so will result in a
failure to compile
-friendship will allow another class to interact with private set things
